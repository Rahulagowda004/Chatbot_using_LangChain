# 🌐 LangChain, LangSmith, and Streamlit Repository

This repository contains implementations of various advanced tools and frameworks, including **LangChain** for memory retention and chatbots, **LangSmith** for prompt engineering, and **Streamlit** for creating interactive applications. These technologies are used to build efficient AI-driven solutions for tasks such as conversation modeling, data retrieval, and interactive web applications.

## 🤖 Tools and Frameworks Included:

1. **LangChain** 🧠  
   A framework designed to simplify the creation of complex language models. It includes components like **memory retention**, **retrievers**, and **chatbots** for building robust AI-driven conversational applications.
   
   - **Memory Retention**: Implements techniques for maintaining state across different interactions, enabling a model to remember previous conversations.
   - **Retriever**: Enhances search capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base to improve model accuracy and context awareness.
   - **Chatbot**: Uses LangChain components to create dynamic and intelligent chatbots capable of handling diverse user queries.

2. **LangSmith** 🔧  
   A powerful tool for **prompt engineering** and **fine-tuning** large language models (LLMs). It provides a streamlined interface to craft, test, and optimize prompts for different AI models.

3. **Streamlit** 🚀  
   A Python library used to quickly create interactive web applications. This repository includes applications built with Streamlit to provide a simple and effective way to interact with AI models and visualizations.

## 🚀 Usage

Each tool or framework in this repository has its own Python script or Streamlit app. To use them:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulagowda004/LangChain.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired directory and run the relevant file:

   - **LangChain Chatbot Example**:
     ```bash
     cd langchain-chatbot
     python chatbot.py
     ```

   - **LangSmith Prompt Engineering**:
     ```bash
     cd langsmith
     python prompt_engineer.py
     ```

   - **Streamlit Web Application**:
     ```bash
     cd streamlit-app
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

## 📋 Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the applications:

- `langchain` 🧠
- `langsmith` ⚙️
- `streamlit` 🌐
- `numpy` ➕
- `pandas` 🐼
- `openai` 💬

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💬 Features

- **Interactive Chatbots**: Powered by LangChain, these chatbots provide rich, memory-driven conversations.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Use LangSmith to create, test, and optimize prompts for large language models.
- **Streamlit Apps**: Build and deploy web apps that integrate LangChain and LangSmith functionality with a simple interface.
